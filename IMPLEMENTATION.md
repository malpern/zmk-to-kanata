> **Note:** Checkmarks (✅) in the plan below indicate completed major steps. For detailed status and sub-steps, see the progress tracker table at the end of this document. Only update checkmarks at the step (macro) level, not on individual sub-bullets.

## Current Status (May 2025)

The converter is in progress with ongoing work on macro handling and test coverage. Current status:

- ✅ Macro transformer implementation fixed
- ✅ Test coverage for macro transformer improved
- ✅ Error handling and validation improved
- ✅ Macro parser error recovery fixed
- ✅ Basic macro tests passing (8/8)
- ⏳ Transformer output formats need standardization

## Detailed Progress Update (June 2025)

### Current Issues
1. Macro Parser:
   - Some linter errors remain (line length and indentation)
   - Need to standardize error messages further

2. Error Handling:
   - Error recovery needs more robust position tracking
   - Need to improve synchronization between parser states
   - Error messages need better context information

3. Testing:
   - 69/208 tests currently passing (improved from 63)
   - Integration tests need updates for new parser behavior
   - Need more test cases for error recovery scenarios

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining linter errors:
   - Address line length issues
   - Fix indentation in continuation lines
   - Standardize error messages

2. Improve test coverage:
   - Add test cases for error recovery
   - Update integration tests
   - Add performance tests for large configurations

3. Documentation:

   - Document token type requirements

## Project Goals

1. Convert ZMK keymap files to Kanata configuration
2. Support all ZMK features including:
   - Layers
   - Macros
   - Combos
   - Hold-tap behaviors
3. Provide clear error messages and validation
4. Maintain high test coverage

# Unified Implementation Plan (April 2025)

### 1. Clarify and Enforce Data Contracts ✅
- Define and document what a "binding" and "layer" should be (use classes, not dicts).
- Add assertions/type checks after parsing bindings and layers.
- Update the parser and binding parser to always return the correct object types for hold-tap, mod-tap, and other behaviors.

### 2. Fix Layer Addition and State Transitions ✅ Complete
- Debug logging is present for layer start, finish, and addition.
- Every parsed layer is finalized and appended to the keymap.
- There are assertions and tests to ensure that for valid files, at least one layer is present after parsing.
- Edge cases and malformed input are handled gracefully with clear errors.

### 3. Key Validation and Filtering ✅
- Filter out non-key tokens (e.g., braces, comments) before passing to the model.
- Ensure each binding is validated before being added to a layer.

### 4. Transformer Standardization ⏳
- Update all transformers to follow standardized output format.
- Ensure consistent structure for all transformers.
- Implement proper handling of nested bindings.
- Fix ZMK to Kanata type mapping.
- Add validation for all transformer outputs.

### 5. Error Handling & Logging ⏳
- Centralized error and warning collection across parser and all transformers, with context-rich logging, summary reporting, fallback mechanisms, robust error recovery, and programmatic access. All issues can be aggregated after a run for a complete report.

### 6. Integration & Testing ⏳
- Consolidate conversion pipeline into a single system.
- Remove special case handling and workarounds.
- Integrate the new parser with existing transformers.
- Create end-to-end tests for complex real-world configurations.
- Test with Ben Vallack's configuration.
- Benchmark performance with large configuration files.
- Re-run all tests after each major step and address new errors as they arise.
- (Optional) Add parser unit tests for parsing a single layer, a single binding, and state transitions.

### 7. Documentation & Cleanup ⏳
- Update documentation to reflect new parsing approach and architecture.
- Add concise examples for common conversion cases (for maintainers).
- Cleanup deprecated code and remove outdated or redundant documentation.
- Ensure consistent coding style and remove duplication.
- Final refactoring and optimization pass.
