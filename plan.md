# ZMK to Kanata Converter Project Plan

## Overview
Convert ZMK keymap configurations to Kanata format, enabling users to migrate their keyboard configurations between these firmware options.

## Implementation Approach
Using a modular design with clear separation between parsing, model representation, and output generation.

## Key Concerns
- Maintain feature parity where possible
- Provide clear error messages for unsupported features
- Generate clean, readable Kanata output
- Follow Python best practices and maintain code quality

## Environment
- Python 3.8+
- pytest for testing
- Black for code formatting
- flake8 for linting

- Implemented key sequence behavior with default values and validation
- Added comprehensive tests for key sequence parsing and case handling
- All current tests passing (74/74)
- Improved error reporting and exit codes for CLI
- Enhanced code organization with new modules for behaviors and parsers
- Fixed key mapping issues in layer_transformer.py for special keys
- Updated test assertions to match actual transformer behavior

## Task 26: Resolve Keymap Model Duplication
### Problem Statement
Currently, there are two versions of the keymap model:
1. `converter/keymap_model.py` (root):
   - Has Binding base class and to_kanata() methods
   - Handles sticky keys, layer switches, and number keys
   - Used by behavior classes and some transformers
2. `converter/model/keymap_model.py`:
   - Has GlobalSettings and KeymapConfig classes
   - More detailed HoldTapBinding with additional parameters
   - Used by parsers and some transformers

This duplication causes:
- Inconsistent behavior depending on which file is imported
- Potential type mismatches and bugs
- Maintenance issues and confusion
- Missing features in code using the older version

### Implementation Plan
#### Short-term Solution
1. Immediate Fix (1-2 days)
   - [x] Add HoldTap class to model/keymap_model.py
   - [x] Update imports across the codebase to use converter.model.keymap_model
     - [x] Update layer_parser.py
     - [x] Update layer_transformer.py
     - [x] Update behaviors/sticky_key.py
     - [x] Update behaviors/key_sequence.py
   - [x] Add deprecation warnings in root keymap_model.py
   - [x] Run tests and fix any import issues
   - [x] Fix linter errors in model/keymap_model.py

#### Long-term Solution (Future Work)
1. Analysis Phase
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for both model versions
   - [ ] Document all current usages and dependencies
   - [ ] Identify unique features in each version
   - [ ] Map out required changes for dependent files

2. Model Consolidation
   - [ ] Create new unified model in `converter/model/keymap.py`
   - [ ] Merge features from both versions:
     - [ ] Binding base class and conversion methods
     - [ ] Global configuration classes
     - [ ] Enhanced HoldTapBinding
     - [ ] Layer and KeyMapping classes
   - [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings
   - [ ] Add type hints
   - [ ] Add validation methods

3. Migration Strategy
   - [ ] Create deprecation warnings in old files
   - [ ] Update imports in behavior classes
   - [ ] Update imports in parser classes
   - [ ] Update imports in transformer classes
   - [ ] Update imports in test files
   - [ ] Verify all tests pass with new model

4. Cleanup
   - [ ] Remove old model files
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [ ] Add migration guide for any external users

### Success Criteria
Short-term:
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Clear documentation of the temporary solution
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] Deprecation warnings in place

Long-term:
- [ ] Single source of truth for keymap model
- [ ] No duplicate code
- [ ] Type-safe implementation
- [ ] Clear documentation
- [ ] Migration guide for users

### Dependencies
- None (can be done independently)

### Estimated Timeline
Short-term: 1-2 days (COMPLETED)
Long-term: 4-6 days (when prioritized)

### Risks
Short-term:
- Minor import adjustments needed
- Potential test failures during transition

Long-term:
- Potential breaking changes for external users
- Complex migration if model differences are significant
- Need to maintain backward compatibility
- Test coverage might need enhancement

### Notes
The short-term solution has been completed. All imports now use converter.model.keymap_model directly, and the HoldTap class has been added to model/keymap_model.py. All tests are passing with no warnings. The long-term solution remains open for future work.
