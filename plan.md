# ZMK to Kanata Converter Project Plan

## Overview
Convert ZMK keymap configurations to Kanata format, enabling users to migrate their keyboard configurations between these firmware options.

## Implementation Approach
Using a modular design with clear separation between parsing, model representation, and output generation.

## Key Concerns
- Maintain feature parity where possible
- Provide clear error messages for unsupported features
- Generate clean, readable Kanata output
- Follow Python best practices and maintain code quality

## Environment
- Python 3.8+
- pytest for testing
- Black for code formatting
- flake8 for linting

## Task 26: Resolve Keymap Model Duplication

Currently, we have two keymap model files:
- `converter/model/keymap_model.py` - The intended source of truth
- `converter/keymap_model.py` - A duplicate with some unique functionality

### Short-term solution (completed)
- [x] Make the root keymap_model.py re-export from the model directory version
- [x] Add deprecation warning to the root version
- [x] Update imports in new code to use the model directory version

### Long-term solution (in progress)
- [x] Move all conversion logic (to_kanata methods) to the model directory version
- [x] Update the HoldTap class in the model directory version to include the more complete to_kanata() method
- [x] Update the KeyMapping class to use a consistent approach for key mapping
- [x] Remove duplicate implementations from the root version
- [x] Update any remaining imports across the codebase to use converter.model.keymap_model directly
- [ ] Eventually remove the root version once all code is migrated

### Analysis
- [x] Document all current usages of both model versions
- [x] Identify unique features in each model version
- [x] Create a migration strategy

### Implementation
- [x] Consolidate the models by moving all functionality to the model directory version
- [x] Ensure all tests pass with the consolidated model
- [x] Update documentation to reflect the changes

### Success Criteria
Short-term:
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Clear documentation of the temporary solution
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] Deprecation warnings in place

Long-term:
- [x] Single source of truth for keymap model
- [x] No duplicate code
- [x] Type-safe implementation
- [x] Clear documentation
- [ ] Migration guide for users

### Dependencies
- None (can be done independently)

### Estimated Timeline
Short-term: 1-2 days (COMPLETED)
Long-term: 4-6 days (COMPLETED except for final removal)

### Risks
Short-term:
- Minor import adjustments needed (MITIGATED)
- Potential test failures during transition (MITIGATED)

Long-term:
- Potential breaking changes for external users (MITIGATED with deprecation warnings)
- Complex migration if model differences are significant (RESOLVED)
- Need to maintain backward compatibility (IMPLEMENTED)
- Test coverage might need enhancement (VERIFIED)

### Notes
Task 26 has been completed. The keymap models have been consolidated with the model directory version as the source of truth. The root version now properly re-exports from the model directory version with deprecation warnings. All tests are passing with no warnings. The only remaining step is to eventually remove the root version once we're confident all external code has migrated.

## Task 27: Fix Remaining Linter Errors
### Problem Statement
There are several linter errors in the codebase that need to be addressed:

1. In `converter/layer_parser.py`:
   - Line length issues on lines 78, 137, and 179
   
2. In `converter/tests/test_layer_transformer.py`:
   - Line length issue on line 61
   
3. In `converter/model/keymap_model.py`:
   - Line length issues on lines 6, 7, 14
   - Visual indentation issue on line 52

These linter errors should be fixed to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Implementation Plan
1. Fix linter errors in `converter/layer_parser.py`:
   - Break long lines into multiple lines
   - Refactor complex expressions

2. Fix linter errors in `converter/tests/test_layer_transformer.py`:
   - Break long assertion into multiple lines or use variables

3. Fix linter errors in `converter/model/keymap_model.py`:
   - Shorten docstring lines
   - Fix indentation in conditional expressions

### Success Criteria
- All linter errors resolved
- All tests still passing
- No new linter errors introduced

### Dependencies
- None

### Estimated Timeline
1 day

### Risks
- Minor risk of breaking functionality when refactoring
- Tests should catch any issues

### Notes
This task is a cleanup task to improve code quality and should be completed before adding new features.
